# Health checks

Internally, FirecREST performs a periodic **health check** of all underlying services that needs to work correctly.

These periodic tests not only provide the users with updated information about the current status of the HPC Center infra, but help FirecREST to run faster and more efficiently.

![f7t_health_checks](../../../assets/img/health_checks.svg)

As you can see in the figure above, when enabled the periodic health check will update the status of

1. HPC cluster connectivity (via SSH)
2. Workload manager and scheduler (via SSH or API calls, depending the service)
3. Filesystem availability (read only)
4. Object storage availability (S3 interface is reachable or not)

## Probing configuration

Health check execution is configured through the `probing` section of the cluster configuration. The supported options are described below.

!!! example "Complete `probing` section in cluster configuration."
    ```yaml
  probing:
    interval_check: 120
    services:
      ssh:
        timeout: 10
      scheduler:
        timeout: 20
      filesystem:
        timeout: 10
    ```

Each service listed under the `services` subsection enables its corresponding health check. Omitting a service disables that specific check. It is allowed to specify a custom timeout, in seconds, for each service: the default is 10 seconds. If a check exceeds its configured timeout, it is considered failed. If the entire `services` section is omitted, all health checks for the specific cluster are disabled.

The `interval_check` field defines how often, in seconds, the health checks are executed for the cluster. If not specified, the default interval is 120 seconds. For backward compatibility the `interval` field is still accepted and behaves identically to`interval_check`, however it is deprecated and it should be replaced with the new field.

Note: the `probing` section is mandatory in the configuration, even if empty.

## Status reports

When consulting the API endpoint `/status/systems` you can see the status of health checks on the response JSON. The filed `servicesHealth` is composed of a list of `serviceTypes` as listed above.

The common format includes:

- `serviceType`: can be (1) `ssh`, (2) `scheduler`, (3) `filesystem`, and (4) `s3`.
- `lastChecked`: timestamp of the last time the periodic test was performed
- `latency`: is used to establish if the service is healthy or not (depends on the configuration of FirecREST)
- `healthy`: `true` or `false`
- `message`: in case of error, it describes why the probe failed

## Improving command execution

Health checks not only provide information about the status of the underlying infrastructure of the HPC center; they enable FirecREST to predict that the command executed in the cluster has a very high probability of being executed as expected.

When enabled, FirecREST will prevent execute commands on unhealthy services

!!! example "API call to an unhealthy endpoint"
    ```bash
    $ curl filesystem/system02/ops/ls?path=/path/to/filesystem02
    {
        "errorType": "error",
        "message": "The ssh service for the requested system (system02) is unhealthy.",
        "data": null,
        "user": "firecr01"
    }
    ```
