- Old link to the installation documentation
- Timeout value for commands executed via `filesystems/ops` and `status` is now configured with command execution timeout setting
- Stdout, stderr path are now fully expanded
- `probing` configuration is optional now for the `clusters` settings

## [2.4.0]

### Added

- Compress and Extract end-points now support multiple compresion types (none, bz2, gzip, and xz).
- Support for Magic Wormhole data transfer method

### Changed

- The System Name path parameter and the corresponding Cluster name configuration are case insensitive.

### Fixed

- Fixed Slurm sacct integration and data parsing. 

- Docker Compose startup: Added dependency for Slurm to wait for Keycloak health check before starting, preventing JWT certificate download failures.
- Upload and Download transfer endpoints now require to specify transfer directives
- Installation docs:
    - Helm charts: FirecREST settings are all included in values.yaml file
    - Changed documentation name from Deployment to Install
- Improved direct upload endpoints size limit checks

## [2.3.1]

### Added

### Changed

- New data_operation setting to replace storage. The new setting decouples the max_ops_file_size parameter from the data_transfer settings that are now a child parameter of data_operation. Also, data_transfer can be of multiple types.
- Certificates debug information when SSH connection fails

### Fixed

## [2.3.0]

### Added

- Add support for the OpenPBS scheduler.

### Fixed

## [2.2.8]

### Added

- Refactor FastAPI models for Slurm, in order to make it easier to add new schedulers.
- Make cp recursive so that directories can also be copied and add the option to keep symbolic links.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed Slurm timestamps parsing issues, timezone was not properly handled.

## [2.2.7]

### Added

- Query parameter `allusers` in `GET /compute/jobs` to show all visible jobs for the user in the scheduler
