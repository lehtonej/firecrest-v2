# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.6.0] - OPEN

### Added

- `name` parameter in `GET /compute/jobs` request
- Added `time_window` query parameter to `GET /compute/{system_name}/jobs` to control how far back historical (completed, failed, cancelled...) jobs are looked up. Accepted values: `1h`, `8h`, `24h`, `3d`, `7d`.

### Changed

- ***⚠️ API Breaking*** Refactored UserInfo response, group and groups objects have been merged.
- ***⚠️ API Breaking*** `GET /compute/{system_name}/jobs` now defaults to a `24h` historical lookback window. Previously the lookback was a fixed 7 days on SSH/CLI-based clusters, and unbounded on REST-based clusters (no time filter was sent to `slurmdb`). Pass `time_window=7d` for the widest supported window.

### Fixed


## [2.5.6]

### Added

### Changed

- SSH connection pool locking is now per-user instead of global, reducing unnecessary SSH connection wait times. The max_clients connection pool setting is no longer a hard limit; under a high number of concurrent requests, the limit may be temporarily exceeded.

- Consolidated logging messages and HTTP tracing headers. Forwarded requests now include X-Request-ID and X-Correlation-ID (instead of X-Trace-Id). 

### Fixed

- Allow command execution when the health check is disabled
- Scheduler in connection mode `ssh` was skipped when RESTAPI `url` option was set.

## [2.5.5]

### Added

- Trace logs now include both request and response trace.

### Fixed

- Fixes truncation of `workingDirectory` in job responses for running/pending jobs caused by `squeue`'s default 20-character column width.
- Fixes error handling of downstream services.
- Fixes log tracing



## [2.5.4]

### Added

- Added partition and reservation override parameters to job submission endpoint.
- Added parameter to shows hidden partitions.
- Added reservation status in API response.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixes reservations date parsing.

## [2.5.3]

### Added

- Configuration setting `token_endpoint_auth_method` to authenticate the health-check client following [OIDC client authentication standards](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication). Defaults to `client_secret_basic` to match pre-2.5.3 behavior.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Aligned livenessProbe timeout with the check_liveness.py script inner timeout value.

## [2.5.2]

### Added


### Changed

- Unified names for subsystems probing and health status: probing key `filesystems` was renamed to `filesystem` (the old label is deprecated but still valid).


### Fixed

- Proper handling of non unicode chars in ssh commands output.


## [2.5.1]

### Added

- Configurable minimum remaining TTL check for incoming OIDC access tokens
- UserInfo endpoint now also includes user's account information (only on Slurm)
- Adds resources requests and limits to helm chart

### Changed

- Nodes status has been normalized across schedulers.

### Fixed

- Slurm job information is now fetched from both the Slurm DB and the Slurm queue allowing to include ineligible jobs' data.
- Fixed issue with health check liveness at deployment time.


## [2.5.0]

### Added

### Changed

- ***⚠️ Configuration Breaking*** `data_operation` and `data_transfer` settings are now configurable independently for each cluster.

### Fixed

- ***⚠️ API Breaking*** Fix transfer directives serialization, now properties names are properly camelcased (see issue: #162).
- ***⚠️ API Breaking*** Handle job arrays in PBS. Job IDs will be strings, and not integers anymore in the API responses.
- Returns an error if the `transfer_method` chosen for large data transfer is not available.
- Documentation about `streamer` and `wormhole` data transfer methods.
- `buffer_limit` for `/filesystem/<system>/ops/*` operation is now adapted to the value of `settings.data_operation.max_ops_file_size` (it was set to the value by default of 5MB).
- Updated Demo launcher configuration.
- Fix error for PBS jobs when no nodes are assigned to it.
- Remove hardcoded jfrog link from the wormhole download endpoint.
- Customizable Response's headers tracing log.

## [2.4.2]

### Added

- File target check in S3 file transfer job for external file upload.
- `cluster.scheduler.connection_mode` setting to configure how the client connects to the scheduler backend (`ssh`, `rest` or `hybrid`)
- Get jobs now allows to specify the account parameter.
- Fine grained probing services per cluster.

### Changed

- Large file download via s3 no longer appends uuid to file name.

### Fixed

## [2.4.0]

### Added

- Compress and Extract end-points now support multiple compression types (none, bz2, gzip, and xz).

### Changed

- The System Name path parameter and the corresponding Cluster name configuration are case insensitive.
